Don't forget to update FileInfo.txt with the latest version information!

First, CD into the xPress source directory. Make sure there is a Build directory containing
  the Icon.ico and FileInfo.txt files

If you use absolute paths for the icon file, fileinfo file, or py source code file be sure
  to surround the paths with spaces (if they contain spaces).

pyinstaller --onefile --icon=Build\Icon.ico --version-file=Build\FileInfo.txt xPress.py
